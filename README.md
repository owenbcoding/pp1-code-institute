Testing
 - I have tested the website in chrome, brave and firefox all works fine.

 - The navigation bar is responsive as well as the gallery looks good in dev tools in other screen sizes.

 - I believe the form will work for a user when they input their details.

Bugs

 - the only bug that I was able to find when I was testing was getting the footer on the home page to stick to the bottom but I managed to fix it!.
